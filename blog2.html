        To begin is the hardest part of any journey but, so is perseverance. Being directionless, I have explored from Electronics to IT. After starting my job, I realised this doesn't excite me that much. I started my diversion towards IT, lockdown became the opportunity and did some courses, in ML by Andrew NG and python specialization (few courses) by Charles Russell. Later on, doing ML n learning a lot of algo's I realised that I am putting my efforts without being smart coz I didnt utilised my learning or made projects anywhere. Though, it was a good understanding and Sir Andrew is a very good instructor. Then I ended up being de-motivated. After sometime, I started coding on leetcode. There again, I was doing sfforts but without knowing should I be doing that or not. A few weeks later, I saw this opportunity of bootcamp and thought to pitch in. I can say, by making this portfolio only and hosting it online, I have gotten to know many concepts, softwares and working of the IT system. But again, its a long way to persevere n start over n over again.
