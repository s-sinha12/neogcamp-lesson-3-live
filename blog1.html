        I was a science stream student. Couldn't make to IIT, or any other prestigious college. I did my bachelors in Electronics and Communication from a state college. I wanted to be in IT sector but somehow ended in main core Electronics. Though learning it for so long, I have developed interest in the field. But, I want to explore IT sector. Work as a Dev-ops Engineer or Full-stack web dev. I just wish if I had known things before taking it up. Most of the plans or happenings were serendipitous. But then, its never too late to start off. I followed Tanay Sir since long via linkedin but got to know about this bootcamp just a day before it kicked off. Maybe it 'll be a turning point, maybe not.. who knows! But a new learning experience.. forsure!
